# Sentiment-Analysis-Project

In this project, I conducted sentiment analysis on IMDB movie reviews using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, including BERT transformer, Word Tokenizer, and CountVectorizer, integrated with Logistic Regression and Random Forest classifiers. 

The analysis delivered actionable insights into audience sentiments, achieving a model accuracy of 78.6% in distinguishing positive and negative reviews, providing valuable support for decision-making in the film industry.
